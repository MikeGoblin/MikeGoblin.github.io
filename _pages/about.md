Greetings! I'm Hanlin Kong, a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Information and Software Engineering](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/) within the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Hailing from Changsha, Hunan Province, I've long been captivated by the boundless potential of AI to reshape our world.

My research interests include *Deep Learning*, *Large Language Models*, *Multi-modal Techniques*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Autonomous Driving*, and *Efficient AI*. Currently, I'm immersed in the dynamic role of a research assistant, contributing to innovative studies in the realms of large language models and autonomous driving. Some highlights of my work can be explored in the [extended abstract](llmtp.html) and [my collections](collection).

Looking forward, I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. program. Semi-skilled in Python (Pytorch for Neural Networks and Flask for Web), I also command a versatile skill set encompassing C/C++, Java, Golang, and SQL. My competencies span deep learning, data analysis, academic visualization, product design, and algorithm development, all of which fortify my endeavors in research and projects.

Please feel free to reach out to me at hanlinkong@foxmail.com. I eagerly anticipate the myriad opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
