Greetings! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Information and Software Engineering](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/) within the esteemed [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Hailing from Changsha, Hunan Province, I've long been captivated by the boundless potential of AI to reshape our world.

Currently, I'm immersed in the dynamic role of a research assistant, contributing to groundbreaking studies in the realms of large language models and autonomous driving. Some highlights of my work can be explored in [Extended Abstract1](URL1) and [Extended Abstract2](URL2).

Looking forward, I aspire to pursue a direct Ph.D. program. Proficient in Python, with expertise in Pytorch for Neural Networks and Flask for Web development, I also command a versatile skill set encompassing C/C++, Java, Golang, and SQL. My competencies span deep learning, data analysis, academic visualization, product design, and algorithm development, all of which fortify my endeavors in research and projects.

Please feel free to reach out to me at hanlinkong@foxmail.com. I eagerly anticipate the myriad opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
