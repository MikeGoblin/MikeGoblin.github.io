- **Competition**
  As a team member, I participated in the Chinese Colleges Computer Competition - Network Technology Challenge, where we developed a web security detection system based on GNN and LLM, and received a **National Grand Prize (the First place in the Undergraduate Group)**. The main document of our work can be viewed [here](/files/C4.pdf).

- **Project**
  As the project leader, I developed a WeChat mini-program platform based on mutual aid among residents for parcel collection, namely 'DyDai', addressing the "last kilometer" delivery challenge. The open source code, prototypes, API document, and introduction are available [here](https://github.com/MikeGoblin/dydai).

  As a Research Assistant, I am engaged in research related to autonomous driving and LLMs. The extended abstract of our latest work is provided [here](llmtp.html).
